# AsciiSeq

This is an idea for a text based midi sequencer inspired by SonicPi and Orca

**NO CODE HAS BEEN WRITTEN YET** This is still in the early design phase.

## Chaining Sequences

```c
1 -> 2
2 -> 3
3 -> 5:4~5:5 		// probability in 10% increments:sequnece_num
4 -> 9:4~1:5 		// this would have 90% chance of repeating, 10% to go to seq 5
// variables aa-zz can store more complex things. All lines must have a go-to (->)
// even if it results in an infinite loop
// a '0→_' can stand in for immediately redirecting to a new decision
a = 5x4 -> 2 		// repeat a sequence, here seq 4 is repeated 5 times, then goto 2
b = 3o4 -> 2		// or the number of notes of a sequence to play (3 notes of seq 4)
c = 1u4 -> 2		// or the sequence, up one octave
d = 1d4 -> 2		// or down an octave
e = 2s4 -> 2		// s for slow, 1/2 speed
f = 2f4 -> 2		// f for fast, 2x speed
g = 1u2s3x3o4 -> 2	// 1 octave up, repeat 3x, at half speed, the first 3 notes of sequence 4
h = 0 -> 3:5xb~7:5  // 30% chance to play the sequnce at b 5 times, 70% to go to seq 5
zz = ...            // variables can be up to two leters in length
// note, that when using a var in a var the go-to of the var will be overridden until the
// calling var completes, so this will still trigger b 4 times before going to 2
5 -> A|5			// until statements, to wait on external input A-Z, think a BARS 5
6 -> 5:g~2:6~3:h 	// 50% chance of going to g's pattern, 20% chance to repeat seq 6, 30% → h
7 -> 2 -> 4 		//the redirect to sequence 3 from sequnce to 2 is overridden, to go to 4 instead
8 -> 0r1 			//play sequence 1 in reverse, note the 0 because reverseing doesn't have any options
```

## Making A Sequence

```c
// avail notes are c,c#,d,d#,e,f,f#,g,g# and n where n is no note.
// flat would be nice, but I think having sytax like eb is very confusing
// and I don't see a better symbol? maybe e♭ with unicode, but that's a bitch to type
// and fucks up the otherwise ascii format
// !n or !c, etc. plays the note with no gate
// notes can also be defined as {40} for example, to play a midi note number.
// any refrences to other sequences are in [brackets] for clarity
// CC's can be set wit {CCnum=val} or {CCLnum=val}
// where the L(ock) varient will default back to the default value set for that CC in the
// config after the note off event
// it would be nice to do time, like with PB, but that would depend on knowing the current CC
// state or at least the last state. Not sure if this is possible. Might need to be a per-CC option?
// PitchBend can be set with {PB=±cents,time}. Assumes a PB range of ±2 semitones unless overridden
// and time is a 10% fraction of the time for the bend to complete. 0 for instant.
1 = a,b@+1,c,d,e,8xf,8rf @-1
// where the 8x is a repeat 8r is a ratchet, and @-1 means to take the entire sequence down 1 
// octave. If the @-1 *didn't* have a space before it, it would only apply to the 8rf before 
// it, as is the case with the b@+1
     
2 = a;c;e,a;d;f,a;c;f;{CC34=127}
// where the ';' allows for polyphony. Note the CC on polyphony to avoid the CC taking a step
3 = ^(a,d,f,a),d,f,a,e
// where ^() is an arpegio forced to fit in the time, so here would be a 4 note arp a,d,f,a
// ^_() will try force a constant gate (no retriggers)
4 = 5:a~5:c,e,5:a~5:!n,c
// 50% chance a, 50% chance c, then e, then a 50% chance of a or no note, then c
5 = [4],a,c
// play sequence 4, followed by a,c
6 = [4d1,4u1],a,c
// play sequence 4 shifted down an octave, followed by seq 4 up 1oct, followed by a,c
7 = [f],a,c
// play sequence at var f, ignoring the go-to, followed by a,c
8 = [1&2]
// play sequence 1&2 in parallel, using polyphony
9 = [0r3],a,c,f
// play seq 3 in reverse
10 = c,!e,f
// ! doesn't send a gate with the note... (how would this work with midi?)
11 = c;{PB=-50,5},e,g
// pitch bend down 50 cents, taking 50% of the note gate time to do so.
12 = $c,d,e$,g,a,c
// start holding the sustain pedal before C is played, release it before g is played
13 = !n,!n,!n,!n
// play no note for 4 notes. Note, that without the '!', this would still emit a gate if
// the last note can have it's gate sustained,
// on that note
14 = c,!n,n
// is equivilent to c,!n,c, as to send a gate (note on) signal requires some note, so the last 
// played note or group of notes is used.
15 = c,{PB=0,5}e,f
// will attempt to pitchbend from c to e in 50% of the gate of the e
15 = c,e{PB=+100,1},f
// will attempt to pitchbend from c to e+100cents in 10% of the gate of the e
// note, if using polyphony and multiple pitch bends are used I could either do MPE
// (probably very, very hard) or just take the first/last pitchbend
// orrrr just throw a syntax error
// note the difference here of the pitchbend not getting it's own note channel, that is
// before the pitch bend was being done polyphonically and in it's own spot
// where this one has a note before it.
16 = c...,e...,f...
// is the same as c,c,c,c,e,e,e,e,f,f,f,f UNLESS the gate lengths have been defined to be under a note
// long, this is a forced gate hold for the sake of operators that are dependent on gate time, 
// the length of the total gate is what the percentage is of, so 
17 = c,e...{PB=0,1},f
// will take 10% of the time of the 4 note gate, not of just one note. This allows for long   // glides
18 = ^(a,a,a,a),d,f,a,e
// ^() can be used for ratchets
19 = ^(a...)
// when the ^() sytax is used with an extended gate, a ratchet is implied, note that adding more '.'s
// further divides the time, making the ratchet faster
20 = ^(c.......)
// would be a twice as fast ratchet (8 notes in the time of 1)
21 = ^(d*12})
// is the same as ^(d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d) is the same as ^(d...........)
22 = c*3,e*97
// this syntax can be used anywhere, but it's a bit gross and easy to mistake for sharps
// still useful for when a note needs to be repeated many times
23 = c#,c#*3,e*97
// I mean it's not that bad, but it's a bit symbol-y
// note that *0 will play indefinitely.
24 = $c,{PB=0,5}e..$,^(f,a,c#);[1&2],[4d1],e,f,[1u2s3x3o4];{CCL34=127},g
// and with that we have a sytax that can get comically gross.
// note on polypony
25 = c;e...,a,d
// the first note will define the length of the note group, so here the c,e... cluster will
// only take 1 note space, and the e... will sustain over the a and d, as well as into the
// first note space of the next pattern
// technically, this could be used to make a drone
26 = !n;e*0
```

```c
// support for some global statments at top of each MIDI channel or top of file for globals
// this will require tracking some stats
MAX_PLAYS = 20
// prevent any sequence from playing more than 20 times
MAX_NOTE = {70}
MIN_NOTE = {8}
// constrain note pitch
PBrange = 24
// set pitchbend range to 24 semitones. Assumes symmetric, so this is ±12 semitones.
CLK_IN = FALSE
// ignore the input midi clock from an external source
CLK_RATE = 120
// BPM if no external source
TRANSPOSE = -12
// Transpose everything down 1 octave
TRANSPOSE_U = +100
// Transpose Everything up 100 cents
RAND_SEED = whatever
// seed for random stuff. If not set, a new seed is chosen on each clock start/stop
CC24 = 0
CC25 = 64
// set the default values for CC's
LAZY_CMAJOR = minor
// sets the notes of the major scale to just be indicators in a different scale
// this is super gross, but for example in C minor
// c stays c, d stays d, e becomes d#, f stays f, g stays g, a becomes a#, and b becomes b#
// this lets noobs like me treat everything like it's major for writing it. This will throw a 
// warning if you try to use a note off the major scale
// combine with transpose to get different keys
// options should be major (no change, but warn about non-major keys), minor, minor_mel, minor_harm,
// penta, and blues. not sure what to do with those with more than 7 notes.
// might let the notes availble expand, so for blues it could be
// a is a, b is a#, c is b, d is c, e is d, f is d#, g is e, then go into non-notes, so
// h is f, i is f#, and j is g      
```

```c
// To get multiple midi channels code can be surrounded with tags, like this. This would only
// include the pattern chaining, as the sequences can go up to arbitary numbers. This would
// allow for sharing sequences between midi channels
